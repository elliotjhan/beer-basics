        If we’re talking about a beverage with literal millennia of 
        history, the answer’s bound to get a little complicated.

        Fortunately for beer lovers and beer newbies everywhere, the basic formula 
        for beer has remained the same for centuries: beer is the fermented, 
        alcoholic product of the careful combination of water, malt, hops, and 
        yeast. 
        That’s it. Okay, so hops weren’t always included in the mix, but 
        we’ll get to that later. Where the modern beer industry is concerned, 
        whatever six pack you pick up from your local refrigerated case, the 
        malt-hops-yeast trifecta will be the secret of its glory. Of course, 
        this being the modern beer industry, there’s also a chance someone got a 
        little inspired and brewed apricots into it, or maybe the beer was “hopped” 
        for an extra long period of time, resulting in a more assertively bitter 
        flavor. But the basic backbone of your beer, from Coors to craft, remains 
        deliciously the same.

      <Text style={styles.baseText}>
      And that’s because you don’t mess with the simplicity of a good recipe. 
      Looking a little more closely, we learn that beer, like leavened bread, 
      is the product of starch-based yeast fermentation. Grains, most often 
      super-starchy barley, are allowed to partially germinate and are then 
      combined with water, creating a kind of cereal mash into which brewers 
      unleash a small, single-celled army of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or 
      brewer’s yeast. Now, yeast love sugar just about as much as a kid in a 
      candy store, except when yeast eat sugar, instead of having a tantrum and 
      sticky fingers, they create magical byproducts: ethanol and CO2, which can 
      show up in various levels in some of our favorite, and least favorite, 
      beers. (Alcohol in a beer is often recorded on the label as “ABV,” alcohol 
      by volume.) Hops, the cone-shaped flower of a tall climbing plant related to 
      Cannabis, are added in the brewing process both as a means of clarification 
      and stabilization, and to impart their signature flavors—which range from 
      bitter and astringent to floral, fruity, and citrusy. And while beers can 
      look anything from ultra-light golden to almost impenetrably rich brown, 
      because the base of the beer is a grain mash, final colors usually tend to 
      land somewhere in the brownish spectrum.

      <Text style={styles.baseText}>
      Again, variations (of the grains or hops or even the yeast strains used) 
      abound, and just like wine, beer can sometimes assume some of the ambient 
      terroir of its environment (indigenous yeast strains, water content, local 
      fruit or hop flavors, etc.). But wherever water, malt, yeast, and hops come 
      together in such a way that fermentation happens, the result—which you might 
      enjoy out of a bottle or can or Solo cup, or maybe even an elegant Pilsner 
      glass—is beer.
